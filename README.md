## Image Similarity

Final project for CS 4363 Computer Vision Fall 2018

Uses a SIFT descriptor as implemented in OpenCV to find the keypoints in the database images,
and then compares them to the comparison image descriptor. Then uses a nearest neighbors comparison to match up keypoints, and
calculate the image similarity.
